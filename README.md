By Nicolas Renaud Kency Quan Jeff Noonan
We conducted a statistical analysis wherein we utilized several supervised learning methods to predict weekly Nasdaq Composite Index returns. We used regression methods to predict weekly percentage returns and classification methods to predict whether the Nasdaq would go up or down over a given week. The set of predictors included the percentage returns and percent changes in trading volume from the previous three weeks.
